# 🧙‍♂️ Quidditch Role Quiz

A delightful and interactive web application built as a fun family project with my kids! Inspired by [WizardMore](https://wizardmore.com/)'s magical quizzes, we created our own special quiz to help young witches and wizards discover their perfect Quidditch team position.

## ✨ About the Quiz

Our quiz uses a weighted scoring system to match players with their ideal Quidditch role:

- 🏃‍♂️ **Seeker**: The quick and focused Snitch-catcher
- 🏈 **Chaser**: The team-oriented scorer
- 🛡️ **Beater**: The protective defender
- 🥅 **Keeper**: The strategic goal guardian

Each answer contributes different weights to each role, helping determine the perfect match for your playing style! Check out our [full quiz questions and scoring system](data/full_quidditch_quiz.json) to see how it works.

## 🎮 Features
